# Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Tic Tac Toe and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Factory Functions and Module Pattern knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Tic Tac Toe game, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The idea is to make the game entirely playable on the console, and only after that, create a graphical UI webpage.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Factory Functions and Module Pattern skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

## If you are reading this
Thank you for your interest! I'm still here, going deeper in Javascript, this shit is getting deep, dark and scary. Hope I can make it...
